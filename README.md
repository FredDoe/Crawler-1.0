# Crawler
A web crawling engine that scrapes data when a set of keywords and a seed url are given to it. 
The user decides the number of total frontiers to crawl before halting.
The crawled data is cleaned and the frequency of occurrence of each keyword searched is determined.
The crawler has a classifier which tries to predict the category of the data and measures the certainty of prediction.
The data is saved to database and also returned to the user for viewing.
